Aliaising in SQL helps to make columm names more readable. It gives the column a temporary name for the sake of clarity mostly. An alias only exists for the duration of that query. You could alias the a column as in the query by adding the _AS_ keyword to indicate an alias after selecting the column field. \n2. The DISTINCT keyword in the SELECT clause is used to eliminate duplicate rows and display a unique list of values. In other words, the DISTINCT keyword retrieves unique values from a table. The basic syntax of the DISTINCT keyword in SQL is: _SELECT DISTINCT._\n3. CREATE VIEW is used in SQL for creating a virtual table of rows and columns defined by the query. It is used before the SELECT query\n# DAY 1\n1. To keep your SQL code readable. Keep the SQL functions/terms in CAPS while the names of the tables, columns etc should be in small letters. \n2.  Always add a semicolon at the end of the query, this helps to indicate the end of the query. ';'\n3. _Select *_ is used when you want to select all columns from a queried table. \n4. SELECT is used to choose the fields that will be included in the result set, while FROM is used to pick the table in which the fields are listed.\n\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3c7f127b-4279-4d0f-a90c-7ddafd5035ed"},{"source":"## Take Notes\n\nAdd notes about the concepts you've learned and SQL cells with queries you want to keep.","metadata":{},"id":"c64eedfa-13c6-439c-b2e2-af637f8aa1aa","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"-- Add your own queries here\nSELECT DISTINCT author\nFROM books\n\n--2nd query\nSELECT *\nFROM books\nLIMIT 5;","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"books","initial":false,"integrationId":"c632441c-e1dc-4637-a56d-10b85efd89be","executionTime":1650,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"-- Add your own queries here\n---SELECT DISTINCT author\n--FROM books\n\n--2nd query\nSELECT *\nFROM books\nLIMIT 5;"},"id":"9e143aa0-9693-4d60-ae1a-85ef3dc3ba3b","cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":3,"data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v1+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"id","type":"integer"},{"name":"title","type":"string"},{"name":"author","type":"string"},{"name":"year","type":"integer"},{"name":"genre","type":"string"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":[{"index":0,"id":1,"title":"10-Day Green Smoothie Cleanse","author":"JJ Smith","year":2016,"genre":"Non Fiction"},{"index":1,"id":2,"title":"11/22/63: A Novel","author":"Stephen King","year":2011,"genre":"Fiction"},{"index":2,"id":3,"title":"12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos","author":"Jordan B.
